# LiveProject_Getting_Started_with_p5js

Beta version of the Manning liveProject - <i>Getting Started with p5.js</i>.

As the author of the project indicates,

"p5.js is a fun and creative framework to learn and flex your creative skills using code and creativity. It is my hope that this intro to p5.js will allow you to see what is possible and encourage you to take it much further with your own ideas and experiments. In this project, we want to slowly build your drawing, animating, and interactive skills for the p5.js framework. I hope by the end of this, it will enable you to explore more about p5.js and apply your own artistic or scientific goals and make them come to life!"

This liveProject is divided into the 4 milestones or exercises shown below.
<ol>
  <li>Just Draw -- learning the basics of drawing on the canvas</li>
  <li>Animate It! -- moving pixels around and making our objects more life-like</li>
  <li>Letâ€™s Be Interactive -- focus on having the canvas take inputs like the keyboard and mouse</li>
  <li>Keep It Swinging -- emulating a swinging pendulum based on some math and animation techniques</li>
</ol>

My renditions of these milestones or exercises are provided in 4 individual directories of this repository that are name accordingly.
