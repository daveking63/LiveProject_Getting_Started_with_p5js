<h2>Milestone 3. Let's be Interactive</h2>

Basic object of this milestone is to add interactivity to the moving rectangles in Milestone 2. In this case interactivity involves a series of movement changes initiated by various keystrokes. In particular the resulting code enables:

<ol>
  <li>When the 'space bar' is clicked reverse the direction of the blue square.</li>
  <li>When the up arrow is clicked, move the blue square up a few pixels on the canvas. If blue square reaches top, moving stops.</li>
  <li>When the down arrow is clicked, move the blue square down a few pixels on the canvas. If blue square reaches bottom, moving stops.</li>
  <li>Clicking the blue square should pause the animation. Clicking it again should resume it.</li>
  <li>Clicking anywhere on the screen (besides the blue square) should move the center of the blue square to the height of the mouse.</li>
</ol>
