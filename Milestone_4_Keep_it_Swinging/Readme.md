<h2>Milestone 4. Keep it Swinging</h2>

The goal of this milestone is to create a sketch that combines two scenarios into one interactive sketch. The two scenarios include:

<ol>
  <li> Left-Right: the Interactive scenario from Milestone 3 which provides mouse and key control of a moving blue rectangle tied to a stationary red rectangle via a line</li>
  <li> Pendulum: a swinging pendulum scenario in which the pendulum consists of a stationary origin represented by a red rectangle, an pendulum arm represented by a line, and a pendulum bob represented by a blue rectangle whose angular movement is guided by various physical laws.</li>
</ol>

A button in the right hand corner of the sketch is used to toggle between the two scenarios.
